# NBA-Dataset-Tableau-Dashboard
Through my analysis of the National Basketball Association players' data, including statistics such as points, rebounds, and other productivity measures as well as other player information such as salaries, team(s), age, position, etc., I decided to test whether or not an NBA player was worthy of their current salary. One step of my analyses was to create meaningful visualizations in Tableau in order to showcase important relationships amomg several variables in my data. The YouTube video details the key findings in creating the dashboard as well as potential reasons for outlier data along with intuitive reasoning for certain patterns and distributions.
